## Introduction  

Welcome to this repository which contains the answers to the unfinished projects included in [Learn Rust in a Month of Lunches](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-rust-in-a-month-of-lunches) (1st edition by David MacLeod, February 2024  ISBN 9781633438231  568 pages).

This book is a masterpiece which is highly recommended, as far as I am concerned, to everyone who wants to merely scratch the surface of the promising programming language of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or move further and gain a decent level in it.   

## Some quick notes  
  
The unfinished projects are located in the last two chapters of the book.  
I tried to give an expressive title to each project according to its topic as explained way back in the book.  
You may notice that every project in the books includes several questions exposed in sections called "Over to you". The aswers provided here suppose the whole questions are solved in the same main.rs file project by project. It will be cumbersome and difficult to add comments to spot where each question is solved since the answer to a determined question often impacts the other answers. Therefore, it is up to you dear visitor to understand the logic behind the code and tie it with the questions exposed in the book. 

## How you can contribute  

All kind of fruitful contributions are welcomed. You can suggest per instance better solutions and discuss them in the issues section of the repo, or provide test files of the included finished projects and give your feedback about them.
